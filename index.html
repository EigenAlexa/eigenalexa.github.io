  <h1>Hi there. My name is Eigen, let's talk</h1>

<p>Eigen is <a href="https://ml.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Machine Learning @ Berkeley's</a> entry into the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexaprize">inaugural Alexa Prize Competition</a>. The goal of the competition is to create a social bot that can maintain a coherent conversation with a human for 20 minutes. We're leveraging the latest results in NLP, machine learning, and deep learning to make this a reality. We're currently working on a demo so you can try it out for yourself. </br></br><a href="mailto:{{site.author.email}}">Email us</a> to learn more.</p>

# Eigen Alexa Website
Soon to be the home of the Eigen Chatbot.

To setup development on the website, you'll need to have ruby installed updated to version 2.3.1+, 
and you'll want to run `bundle install` when you first download.

To test locally, run 
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

If you want to test on the github server, merge into the gh-pages branch, that way we keep master as the master branch. You can access the url of the development branch [here](https://eigenalexa.github.io/eigenalexa.github.io)
